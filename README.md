# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses aiming to retain their customers. This project applies machine learning techniques to predict customer churn using various classification models.

# Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
* numpy - Numerical computing
* pandas - Data manipulation
* matplotlib, seaborn - Data visualization
* sklearn - Machine learning utilities
* imblearn - Handling imbalanced datasets (SMOTE)
* xgboost - Gradient boosting algorithm

# Data Preprocessing

* Load the dataset using pandas.
* Handle missing values.
* Encode categorical variables using LabelEncoder.
* Balance the dataset using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

# Machine Learning Models Used

## The following models are used for predicting churn:

* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* XGBoost Classifier
* Model Evaluation

## The models are evaluated using:

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
* Cross-validation for model stability

# Results

The performance of different models is compared based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
The best-performing model can be used to make predictions on new customer data.
